        <h1 class="dark-data-reduction-header">Reducing Dark Data</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p class="dark-data-reduction-header-paragraph">
      There are many methods to reduce dark data, applicable to both businesses and individuals.
    </p>
  </div>

      <!-- Methods Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>

        <h3>Digital Cleanups</h3>
        <p>
          Conduct thorough digital cleanups on devices, helping identify old
          photos or messages that are no longer needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Regular Cloud Storage Audits</h3>
        <p>
          Regularly review cloud storage to avoid accumulating forgotten data,
          particularly useful for businesses facing 'data silos.'
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Silos Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-silos">
        <h2>Data Silos</h2>
        <p>
          Data silos refer to data held by one group that isn't easily
          accessible to others within the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tools such as data discovery, data classification, and data security
          can help manage these silos.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Discovery Tools Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-discovery-tools">
        <h2>Data Discovery Tools</h2>
        <h3>Data Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          Data discovery tools identify hidden dark data through search engines
          and keywords.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Classification</h3>
        <p>
          Data classification tools help identify sensitive data that requires
          enhanced protection.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
          Data security tools ensure that dark data is safe from hackers by
          encrypting it and managing access within the company.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Identifying Dark Data Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-identifying">
        <h2>Identifying Dark Data</h2>

        <h3>Data Staleness</h3>
        <p>
          Data staleness indicates if data has not been modified recently,
          serving as a good indicator of dark data.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Redundancy</h3>
        <p>
          Data redundancy occurs when multiple copies of the same data exist,
          often due to repeated data gathering in campaigns.
        </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Techniques like data similarity discovery can help uncover these
          redundancies.

      <p>Data silos are what they call data which is held by one group not that are not easily or fully
         accessible to other groups of the company, for these you should use data discovery, data classification
          and data security tools.<b>(Robinson, Stedman and Fredsall (2024)) </b>
       </p>

      <p>
        Data discovery tools help find the dark data that is hidden through means like search engines
         and key words, data classification tools help you tell which data is more sensitive and requires better protection,
          data security tools help you keep the dark data you have safe from potential hackers through encrypting it and
           providing it a more secure location, this also helps keep manage who has access to the dark data in the company.
            These all help the dark data you have become more secure and open to all who need it in the company which in turn
             lessens the amount of dark data present in the company.<b>(DOMO (no date))</b>

      </p>
      <p>
        There are more ways of finding dark data in the company, like data staleness, which is what shows if
         data has not been modified in a long period of time and is a good indicator of that data being dark data, there is
          also data redundancy which is when you have multiple copies of the same files/data in your system which can happen
           when companies do things like campaigns and gather data from their consumers and then a short while later do another
            campaign and instead of reusing the data they gather more of the same data that they already have stored, you can get
             help discovering these similarities through ml(machine learning) techniques like 'data similarity discovery'.<b>(Atlan(2023))</b> 
      </p>
      <p>(4, Sony Shetty (2017)) Employees tend to save everything which builds piles of data that end up not used, the mantra of “saving
         everything just in case” that most corporations also feed this behaviour. Alan Dayley says, “increased data growth over the past
          decade has created an unstructured data nightmare,” which shows that as the years go by, we are gathering more and more data,
           which in turn ends up piling up as dark data. He continues with, “It’s not just the cost to store it. Huge volumes of dark data
            make it harder to find what is useful and may mean we miss business opportunities,” which shows that the data gathered that ends
             up not actively used will bring extra costs to the company as well as preventing them from using data which could have otherwise
              helped them find new opportunities. 
        For these problems he gives some recommendations for tackling dark data: “1. To start today,” since leaving it for longer will
         only cause for more dark data to pile up which will eventually end up forcing you to sort it out anyway, “2. Reach out to all
          of the stakeholders and trim the involvement of any unnecessary but interested parties” which can help with any decision making
           the company has to do, due to having less stakeholders it is easier to uphold policies about cleaning files of unneeded data etc.
            And then “3. Take action — Move the data, secure the data, create accessibility of the data or delete the data, depending on the
             desired business outcome.” which, as it says is about the company ensuring that the data is either moved to a secure location with
              a label or deleted if deemed unnecessary. </p>
