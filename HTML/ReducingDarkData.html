      There are many methods to reduce dark data, applicable to both businesses and individuals.

        <h2>Methods</h2>

        
        <p> Doing thorough digital cleanups on their devices since going through your
            device may lead to you finding old photos or messages that are saved but you may no longer need.<br>
             Going through any cloud storage you have regularly so you do not pile up on data you may
              have saved a long time ago but have forgotten.<br> This also works for companies that have perhaps
               been building up ‘data silos’. <a href="./bibliography.html#Reduce dark data"  >(Atlan(2023))</a>  </p>

      <!-- Data Silos Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-silos">
        <h2>Data Silos</h2>
        <p>Data silos are what they call data which is held by one group not that are not easily or fully
          accessible to other groups of the company.<br> For these you should use data discovery, data classification
           and data security tools.<br><a href="./bibliography.html#Reduce dark data"  >(Robinson, Stedman and Fredsall (2024))</a></p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Discovery Tools Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-discovery-tools">
        <h2>Tools to help</h2>
        
        <p>
          Data discovery tools identify hidden dark data through search engines
          and keywords.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          Data classification tools, which help identify sensitive data that requires
          enhanced protection.
        </p>

       
        <p>
          Data security tools, which ensure that dark data is safe from hackers by
          encrypting it and managing who access it within the company.

      <div class="dark-data-reduction-identifying">
        <h2>Identifying Dark Data</h2>

       
        <p> There are many ways to identify dark data, like data staleness and data redundancy, for more information on these topics and more, the '<a href="./darkDataHistoryAndExamples.html" class="DarkDataFactors">What is dark data</a>' page, under dark data factors.
        </p>

        <p>Finding data insecurities are important since when files are not secured properly it goes against laws like HIPAA and GDPR and result in the company getting into trouble from consumers</p>
      </div>

      <div class="dark-data-reduction-identifying-solutions1">
        <h3>Other methods that companies can use to reduce the amount of dark data in their systems are using people and processes:</h3>

        <p>People: Companies should have their workers do scheduled purges of any unneeded or stale data, they can also ensure any new hires
          have a good understanding of digital hygiene in the workplace through having programs they take or something similar.</p>

          <p>Processes: Companies can also use processes like policies on how to retain and reuse data, ensure data has labels and have sufficient protection.
            They can also set up certain days that encourages employees to take a look at the data usage and identify data that needs discarded. </p>

             <div class="dark-data-reduction-identifying-solutions2">
      <h3>Some recommendations given by Alan Dayley for tackling dark data:</h3>
        <p>
           “1. To start today,” since leaving it for longer will
        only cause for more dark data to pile up which will eventually end up forcing you to sort it out anyway,<br><br>
         “2. Reach out to all
         of the stakeholders and trim the involvement of any unnecessary but interested parties” which can help with any decision making
          the company has to do, due to having less stakeholders it is easier to uphold policies about cleaning files of unneeded data etc.<br><br>
           And then “3. Take action — Move the data, secure the data, create accessibility of the data or delete the data, depending on the
            desired business outcome.” which, as it says is about the company ensuring that the data is either moved to a secure location with
             a label or deleted if deemed unnecessary.<a href="./bibliography.html#Reduce dark data"  >(Sony Shetty (2017))</a></p>
