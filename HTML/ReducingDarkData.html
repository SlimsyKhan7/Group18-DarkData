    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p class="dark-data-reduction-header-paragraph">
      There are many methods to reduce dark data, applicable to both businesses and individuals.
    </p>
  </div>

      <!-- Methods Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>

        
        <p> Doing thorough digital cleanups on their devices since going through your
            device may lead to you finding old photos or messages that are saved but you may no longer need.<br>
             Going through any cloud storage you have regularly so you do not pile up on data you may
              have saved a long time ago but have forgotten.<br> This also works for companies that have perhaps
               been building up ‘data silos’.(Atlan(2023)) </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Silos Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-silos">
        <h2>Data Silos</h2>
        <p>Data silos are what they call data which is held by one group not that are not easily or fully
          accessible to other groups of the company.<br> For these you should use data discovery, data classification
           and data security tools.<br>(Robinson, Stedman and Fredsall (2024))</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Discovery Tools Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-discovery-tools">
        <h2>Tools to help</h2>
        
        <p>
          Data discovery tools identify hidden dark data through search engines
          and keywords.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          Data classification tools, which help identify sensitive data that requires
          enhanced protection.
        </p>

       
        <p>
          Data security tools, which ensure that dark data is safe from hackers by
          encrypting it and managing who access it within the company.

      <!-- Identifying Dark Data Section -->
      <div class="dark-data-reduction-identifying">
        <h2>Identifying Dark Data</h2>

        <h3>Data Staleness</h3>
        <p>
          Data staleness indicates if data has not been modified recently,
          serving as a good indicator of dark data.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Redundancy</h3>
        <p>
          Data redundancy occurs when multiple copies of the same data exist,
          often due to repeated data gathering in campaigns.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Techniques like data similarity discovery can help uncover these
          redundancies.
        </p>

        <p>if not secured properly will go against laws like HIPAA and GDPR and result in the company getting into trouble from consumers</p>
        <h3>Other methods that companies can use to reduce the amount of dark data in their systems are:</h3>

        <p>People, companies should have their workers do scheduled purges of any unneeded or stale data, they can also ensure any new hires
          have a good understanding of digital hygiene in the workplace through having programs they take or something similar.</p>

          <p>processes,Companies can also use processes like policies on how to retain and reuse data, ensure data has labels and have sufficient protection.
            They can also set up certain days that encourages employees to take a look at the data usage and identify data that needs discarded. </p>
           
             </p>
      </div>

      <p>Employees tend to save everything which builds piles of data that end up not used, the mantra of “saving
        everything just in case” that most corporations also feed this behaviour. Alan Dayley says, “increased data growth over the past
         decade has created an unstructured data nightmare,” which shows that as the years go by, we are gathering more and more data,
          which in turn ends up piling up as dark data. He continues with, “It’s not just the cost to store it. Huge volumes of dark data
           make it harder to find what is useful and may mean we miss business opportunities,” which shows that the data gathered that ends
            up not actively used will bring extra costs to the company as well as preventing them from using data which could have otherwise
             helped them find new opportunities.(Sony Shetty (2017)) </p>
      <p> For these problems he gives some recommendations for tackling dark data: “1. To start today,” since leaving it for longer will
        only cause for more dark data to pile up which will eventually end up forcing you to sort it out anyway, “2. Reach out to all
         of the stakeholders and trim the involvement of any unnecessary but interested parties” which can help with any decision making
          the company has to do, due to having less stakeholders it is easier to uphold policies about cleaning files of unneeded data etc.
           And then “3. Take action — Move the data, secure the data, create accessibility of the data or delete the data, depending on the
            desired business outcome.” which, as it says is about the company ensuring that the data is either moved to a secure location with
             a label or deleted if deemed unnecessary.(Sony Shetty (2017))</p>
