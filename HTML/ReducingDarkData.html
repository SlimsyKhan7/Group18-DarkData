         Reducing Dark Data

      </section>
      <p>
        There are many ways to reduce dark data, and these can apply both businesses and individuals.<br>
         These methods include doing thorough digital cleanups on their devices since going through your 
         device may lead to you finding old photos or messages that are saved but you may no longer need, <br>
         you should go through any cloud storage you have regularly so you do not pile up on data you may have saved
          a long time ago but have forgotten, this also works for companies that have perhaps been building up
           ‘data silos’. <br> <b>(Atlan (2023))</b>
      </p>

      <p>Data silos are what they call data which is held by one group not that are not easily or fully
         accessible to other groups of the company, for these you should use data discovery, data classification
          and data security tools.<b>(Robinson, Stedman and Fredsall (2024)) </b>
       </p>

      <p>
        Data discovery tools help find the dark data that is hidden through means like search engines
         and key words, data classification tools help you tell which data is more sensitive and requires better protection,
          data security tools help you keep the dark data you have safe from potential hackers through encrypting it and
           providing it a more secure location, this also helps keep manage who has access to the dark data in the company.
            These all help the dark data you have become more secure and open to all who need it in the company which in turn
             lessens the amount of dark data present in the company.<b>(DOMO (no date))</b>

      </p>
      <p>
        There are more ways of finding dark data in the company, like data staleness, which is what shows if
         data has not been modified in a long period of time and is a good indicator of that data being dark data, there is
          also data redundancy which is when you have multiple copies of the same files/data in your system which can happen
           when companies do things like campaigns and gather data from their consumers and then a short while later do another
            campaign and instead of reusing the data they gather more of the same data that they already have stored, you can get
             help discovering these similarities through ml(machine learning) techniques like ‘data similarity discovery’.<b>(Atlan(2023))</b>
