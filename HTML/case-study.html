                How much Data is collected, how much unused data exists in, what 
                can be/ has to be done to reduce dark data. This will explore the 
                use of Emojis, AI and pictures/videos & their impacts.
            </p>
        <h2 class="cloud-storage-header">Emojis</h2>
        <p class="cloud-storage-parra">
            Each time someone send a text message or makes a social media post with an emoji 
            in it needs to be stored. Emojis like other characters use 4 bits to be represented. 
            According to multiple sources there is on average 10 billon emojis sent every day 
            thatâ€™s 40,000,000,000 bytes or 40 Gb a day. Think about that over a year is 14.6 Tb 
            all of them emojis need to be stored. Emojis were made in 1999 however on became 
            popular in 2010 so take 2010 as the starting point over 24 years there could be up 
            to 350 Tb of emojis used. This is a lot of data to be storing. We could reduce the 
            amount of emojis we use to stop making all of this dark data or storage facilities 
            could remove them but ether way not all this dark data is going to stop. For example 
            take a Facebook post, Facebook is not going to remove your post and you might not want 
            to remove your post so that dark data will always be there.

            <h2>AI</h2>
            <p>
                Each time we use ChatGPT, it uses a small amount of energy, around 2.9Wh per query, 
                which is almost ten times more than a single google search, according to IEA. We 
                estimated that each of us on average asks 5 queries to Chat GPT per day, leading to a 
                daily energy consumption of 14.5Whs per person. Over a year our total energy consumption 
                created by Chat GPT would result in 31.74kWhs, or 6.8kgs of CO2. Which according to the 
                EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) would equate to driving a car for 17 miles.   

                The UK has a population of about 69 million people, if 95% of the population that use a 
                phone all use Chat GPT 5 times a day that would equal 327.5 million queries daily or 970.75MWhs of 
                energy each day. Over a year this would be 346,523,750 kWh, this could power 116,000 
                3-bedrooms houses in the Uk for a full year. This would emit 164,099,281 kg of CO2 each year, the 
                same as 410 million miles in a car, with that distance you could drive to the moon and back just 
                over 858 times (NASA)
            </p>

            <h2>Pictures</h2>
            <p>
                A case study in 2021 has shown that people took around 900 photos a year, 
                and the images that are not wanted but saved alone could accumulate 10.6 kg of CO2 emissions yearly 
                through storing the data on servers and data centers. So, if we say that around 300 photos are 
                duplicates or unwanted that would be 0.035kg or 35g of CO2 emissions per photo saved (Iryna Komazova (2024))
                <br><br>
                In a week we have taken a total of 252 photos, which would be around 8.82kg of CO2 emissions. On 
                average that's 42 photos per person which would be 1.47kg of CO2 released  (Nick Baker (2024)) 
            
                
                <br><br>
                In a country such as the United Kingdom which has a population of roughly 69 million, 
                and is predicted to have around 95% of people have mobile phones, which would be around 65.5 million 
                people with phones in the Uk. 
                <br><br>
                Using the data for our group we can find that the Uks population would take roughly 2,898,000,000 
                photos per week. This would give out 101,430,000kg of CO2 emissions
