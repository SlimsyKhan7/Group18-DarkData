            <h2 class="DarkDataHistoryTitle">Dark Data History</h2>
            <h3>
                The history of Dark data doesn't give much information on how it came to be. The growth of the amounts of Dark data
                started with the fast increase in digitalisation in business processes, from service logs to customer interaction
                recordings. Companies can now store giant massive of information, but because of technical limitations or resource
                constraints, it is often unused, hence, just takes the needed space. Let's see how it appears in the first place.
            </h3>
        </div>

        <!-- Dark Data Appearance Reasons-->
         <div class="DarkDataAppearance">
            <h2>Dark Data Appearance Reasons</h2>
            <h3>
                So, there's the question - how data becomes dark? And, believe me, reasons are the most diverse ones.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Human factor would be one of them, or, to be precise - lack of awareness. The processes are mundane, 
                        and records are lead every day, but organisations might not understand its value, or not know of its 
                        existence at all, which leads to it being forgotten.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next - companies split into departments, each of them has their own database, and receive different massive of
                        information, but one can beunreachable for other, who could find it useful - what leads to data being stuck in silos. Of
                        course, people are notomnipotent, and can just lose track of information in the robust ecosystem, what is considered a
                        lack of datagovernance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coming back to the robust ecosystems - they are constantly updated, and legacy systems can retire and become
                        less relevant, and cannot be integrated, or not integrated fully, creating gaps and inconsistencies, false links and
                        lost data, namely, incomplete data integration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Businesses can develop overtime and change their priorities, but pastdata can be stored, even though it's irrelevant to
                        the current scope of development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New companies are quite limited in data acquirement, so they focus its collection rather than analysis. It comes out to
                        be a problem when they grow and need to use the data they have, but cannot possibly do it, as there is too much data to
                        be aware of, and it's lost in process. Also, insufficient data literacy can prevent data from being fully used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A lot of standards strictly forbid companies from saving sensitive data more than allowed, andbecause of giant everyday
                        data flow, they might not be able to keep track of the sensitive information, and it's beingkept much longer after the
                        mandatory period and lost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, last reason would be “Redundant, obsolete, trivial data”or ROT, which is created when employees save multiple
                        copies of the same information, or the info is itself outdated anddoesn't help company in reaching its goals.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dark Data Examples and Factors</h2>
            <!-- Dark Data Generation Types-->
            <div class="DarkDataGenerationTypes">
                <h2>Dark Data Generation Types</h2>
                <h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            First type of Dark data is a machine-generated one. Basically, the devices we use, like cameras or sonars, collect all
                            the data they can, varying from temperature and humidity and reaching such heights as visual and sound detection. Even
                            though this information might provide valuable insights, but, sadly, most of it is not used correctly, and, in the end,
                            being lost on the servers, not accessible, but taking up space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Second type of Dark data is customer-generated. Main source of that information is humanity, and it's personal for
                            everyone. All the preferences, likes, dislikes can be recorded, as well as every email, letter or text is saved. But,
                            alike to the first type, it is not being sorted properly, and instead of enhancing the experience, it often gets lost,
                            only taking up space in the end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Last, but not the least would be business-generated data, which, as stated from the name, is generated mostly for
                            business purposes, for example, purchase invoices, statistics, or employee communications. Gathered every day in
                            databases, and used for experience enhancement as well, but the remaining data becoming just another dark data.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </h3>
            </div>
            <!-- Dark Data Structurisation Types -->
             <div class="DarkDataStructureTypes">
                <h2>Dark Data Structurisation Types</h2>
                <h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            First would be structured Dark data. Clearly defined data, that is put and sorted in the spreadsheets and databases,
                            examples would be, again, server log files, sensor data from IoT, that is discussed above, or electronic bank statements
                            with customer data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next example is an unstructured Dark data - which can't be automatically organised without conversion, hence, requires
                            manual sorting. We can take any social media posts, PDFs, recorded calls or videos from surveillance cameras as
                            representatives for this type of data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeating myself, last type of Dark data would be semi-structured, that takes features from both previous types. Even
                            though it can't be fully sorted, it does contain some information in defined data fields. As software developers, that
                            our forte - HTML, CSS codes, graphs, invoice documents or tables.
                        </li>

                <h2>Dark Data Factors</h2>
                <h3>
                    This part is a quick description of Dark Data Factors, in "Q&A style".
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            First factor is staleness. “How much time had passed since the last modification?” - if the answer is “a lot”, then it's
                            considered stale.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next - popularity score. “How trusted the source of the information?” or “How many people use this source daily?” - main
                            questions in finding out dark data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Furthermore, another factor is data provenance. “Is this data mainstream and is it used in data pipelines?” - No? Then
                            its outdated and expects update, or it will be considered just another piece of dark data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fourth - quality. We're talking about style of the data. “Does it contain duplicate values, incorrect patterns, or part
                            of data is missing at all?” - If any of those questions have a positive answer, you have to solve the problem before it
                            becomes forgotten.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Redundancy - “How many copies of the same information does the system have?”. It can be spotted by using data similarity
                            discovery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, classification - “Data should be labelled, classified and signed”. Otherwise, it might just result in a data
                            breach.
                        </li>
