          Environmental Impacts of Data Centres and Dark Data
        </h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="environmental-impacts-introduction">
          Data centres account for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas
          emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2024).
          There are several key factors contributing to this.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Continuous Operation and Power Consumption Section -->
      <div class="environmental-impacts-operation">
        <h2>Continuous Operation and Power Consumption</h2>
        <p>
          Data centres operate non-stop, 365 days a year, requiring a constant
          power supply to run. This power often comes from non-renewable sources
          such as oil and coal, further contributing to the CO₂ output of these
          data centres. In 2022, the IEA estimated that all global data centres
          consumed more than 300 TWh of electricity annually. The World Economic
          Forum states that “companies produce 1,300,000,000 gigabytes of dark
          data a day.” This exponential increase of unused data causes companies
          to construct more and more data centres, increasing their CO₂ output
          and putting unnecessary strain on power grids.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Cooling Requirements Section -->
      <div class="environmental-impacts-cooling">
        <h2>Cooling Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Cooling is another significant source of energy consumption in data
          centres. During operation, data centres generate a large amount of
          heat, and without an adequate cooling system, they would be unable to
          function efficiently. These cooling systems further contribute to
          their high energy consumption and environmental footprint. Many data
          centres use water cooling systems, whether evaporative cooling—where
          water evaporates using hot air, causing the air to cool down—or
          immersion cooling, which submerges the full server bank in a special
          liquid. These methods use large amounts of water, amounting to almost
          5 million gallons per day, according to Becky Mckay at Green Match.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Land Usage Section -->
      <div class="environmental-impacts-land-usage">
        <h2>Land Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Data centres take up large areas of land, with an average facility
          being around 100,000 square feet, leading to the shift of natural
          habitats and plant life. The largest example is China's Telecom Inner
          Mongolia Information Park, which is the largest data centre in the
          world, spanning an astonishing 10.7 million square feet and requiring
          150 megawatts of electricity per hour, consuming approximately 1.3 TWh
          annually (World's Top Data Centres, 2023). The construction of these
          massive data centres leads to deforestation and the destruction of
          animal habitats, causing biodiversity loss that has terrible effects
          on the environment, including increased CO₂ levels in the atmosphere.
        </p>

      <!-- Environmental Cost of Constructing a Data Centre Section -->
      <div class="environmental-impacts-construction">
        <h2>Environmental Cost of Constructing a Data Centre</h2>
        <p>
          However, the operation of these data centres is not the only factor
          responsible for their environmental impact. The construction of these
          massive facilities requires significant amounts of cement, steel, and
          other building materials, all of which consume large amounts of
          energy. According to Chatham House, cement production alone accounts
          for 8% of global CO₂ emissions annually, making it one of the most
          polluting industries in the world. Cement is created by heating
          limestone to high temperatures, emitting large amounts of CO₂.
          Additionally, hundreds or even thousands of construction workers, many
          relying on gas-powered vehicles, need to commute to the building site.
          The construction of these data centres can last several years, further
          worsening their overall environmental impact. Furthermore, data
          centres generate significant amounts of electronic waste, which is
          notoriously difficult to recycle. They create this waste as the
          technology used to manage data centres constantly advances and
          requires frequent replacement. Data centres are responsible for 4% of
          yearly e-waste produced, generating around two million tons annually,
          according to Green Revolution Cooling.

      <!-- What Can Be Done Section -->
      <div class="environmental-impacts-solutions">
        <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the largest tech companies are starting to adopt clean energy
          solutions, with AWS, Microsoft, Meta, and Google being the top four
          buyers of clean energy from 2010-2021, according to the IEA. This
          shift will significantly help reduce the carbon footprint of data
          centres.
