<h1>Environmental Impacts of data centres and Dark Data</h1>
<p> Data centres account for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2024). There are several key factors of why this is:</p>
<h2> Continuous Operation and Power Consumption  </h2>
<p> Data centres operate non-stop, 365 days a year, requiring a constant power supply to run. 
    This power often comes from non-renewable sources such as oil and coal, 
    further contributing to the CO2 output of these data centres. 
    In 2022, the IEA estimated that all global data centres consumed more than 
    300 TWh of electricity annually. 
    The World Economic Forum states that “companies produce 1,300,000,000 gigabytes of dark data a day” 
    This exponential increase of unused data causes companies to construct more and more data centres, 
    only increasing their CO2 output as well as putting unnecessary strain on power grids.  
</p>
<h2> Cooling Requirements</h2>
<p> Cooling is another significant source of energy consumption in data centres. 
    During operation data centres generate a large amount, and without an adequate cooling system 
    they would be unable to function efficiently. These cooling systems further contribute to their 
    high energy consumption and environmental footprint. 
    Many Data centres use water cooling system whether this is evaporative cooling a method that 
    evaporates water using hot air causing the air to cool down which is then passed through 
    the data centre, or immersion cooling which emerges the full server bank in a special liquid. 
    These methods use large amounts of water which amounts to almost 5 million gallons per day 
    according to Becky Mckay at Green Match. </p>
<h2> Land Usage</h2>
<p> Data centres take up large areas of land, with an average facility being around 100,000 square feet, 
    leading to the shift of natural habitats and plant life. 
    The largest example is China's Telecom Inner Mongolia Information Park, 
    which is the largest data centre in the world, 
    spaning an astonishing 10.7 million square feet and requiring 150 megawatts of electricity per hour,
    consuming approximately 1.3 TWh annually. (World's Top Data Centres,2023) 
    The construction of the huge data centres leads to great areas of land being deforested and the 
    destruction of animal habitats. This biodiversity loss has terrible effects on the environment, 
    increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere </p>
<h2> Environmental Cost of Constructing a Data centre</h2>
<p> However, the operation of these Data Centers is not entirely responsible for their environmental Impact. 
    The construction of these massive facilities requires lots of cement, steel and other building 
    materials, the production of which uses lots of energy. According to Chatham House, cement production 
    alone is responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions annually (Chatham House), 
    making it one of the most polluting industries in the world. 
    Cement is created by heating limestone to great temperatures, emitting large amounts of CO2. 

    Additionally, hundreds or even thousands of construction workers, many of whom rely on 
    gas-powered vehicles, need to commute to the building site, the construction of these data centres 
    can last several years, worsening the overall environmental impact of these centres. 
    
    Furthermore, Data Centers create magnitudes of electronic waste which is notoriously difficult to 
    recycle. They create this waste as the technology used to manage a data centre constantly advances 
    and they frequently need replacing. Data Centres are responsible for 4% of yearly E-Waste produced 
    each year, producing two million tons according to Green Revolution Cooling</p>
    <h2> What can be done?</h2>
    <p> Already we can see that many of the largest tech companies are already starting to adopt 
        clean energy with AWS, Microsoft, Meta, and Google being the top four buyers of 
        clean energy from 2010-2021 according to the IEA. 
        This will help greatly to reduce the carbon footprint of data centres. </p>
