    <h1> The positive uses of Dark Data</h1>

    <p> Whilst Data scientists and economists have justified concerns about Dark Data, it is important to understand that, like all things, Dark Data can be used in positive ways.</p>

    <p> The hard part, as with all things, is organizing the data. For many organizations, Dark Data has been piling up for decades, and going through it all is a long, monotonous task that requires a huge amount of manpower. As we enter the AI era, this task will become far easier, and more companies may start to clear out their storage.</p>

    <p> Once all the data has been prepared, it can be used productively to optimize the systems used by businesses daily. Dark Data's potential is untapped, but some of the few things it could be used for are; Improving supply chain systems, improving customer satisfaction, increasing a business's general productivity and training AI.</p>

    <h2> Training AI for specialised tasks </h2>

    <p> AI learns like a child; It grows its knowledge by reading information and experiencing things. Nothing but the very basics was ever programmed into an AI system. Dark Data can be used to exponentiate the time it takes for AI to learn a specific skill.</p>
    <p> Essentially, more data means a greater bank of knowledge which allows the AI to be more accurate in its responses.</p>

    <h2> Optimising manufacturing and supply chain systems</h2>

    <p> One of the most significant causes of delays in manufacturing is the lack of consistency or poor configuration in machinery.</p>
    <p> n article by Splunk on the topic mentioned that by analyzing automatically generated system logs, systems can be tweaked and recalibrated to ensure the best possible performance, leading to more time-efficient systems and ultimately better profit margins.</p>

    <h2> Improving general Customer Experience </h2>

    <p> For the success of a business, it is vital that the customer has easy, good experience with the business and the products or services that it offers.</p>
    <p> From analyzing dark data, a pattern of behaviors can usually be found, whether that is the popularity of the product in certain areas, the time between purchases or success of marketing.</p>
    <p> This can all be put together to form a larger picture which allows businesses to tailor their strategy to attract more sales.</p>

    <p> A largely untapped market for easy brand analysis is social media; </p>
    <p> social media interactions and analytics do qualify as Dark Data, per the definition. In the current day, social media is one of the most effective and one of the simplest ways to understand how the public feel about your product. </p>
    <p> Whilst almost every social media features the option to look at engagement (i.e watchtime, views, likes etc.) and is widely used by companies. </p>
    <p> The other component of Dark Data from Social media , the physical engagement, is far less used, but is just as indicative. Things like monitoring customer messages and comments asking questions or providing feedback are rarely practiced, but it is an easy way to boost the understanding of the way people feel about the brand. </p>

    <p> In an article regarding the topic, Alexis C. Madrigal of the Atlantic commented: “Surprisingly, almost 70% of all social media interactions with brands are classified as Dark Data”</p>
