        <h1 class="positive-uses-header">The Positive Uses of Dark Data</h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="positive-uses-introduction">
          Whilst data scientists and economists have justified concerns about
          dark data, it is important to understand that, like all things, dark
          data can be used in positive ways.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Organizing Dark Data Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-organizing">
        <h2>Organizing Dark Data</h2>
        <p>
          The hard part, as with all things, is organizing the data. For many
          organizations, dark data has been piling up for decades, and going
          through it all is a long, monotonous task that requires a huge amount
          of manpower. As we enter the AI era, this task will become far easier,
          and more companies may start to clear out their storage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Productive Uses Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-productive">
        <h2>Productive Uses</h2>
        <p>
          Once all the data has been prepared, it can be used productively to
          optimize the systems used by businesses daily. Dark data's potential
          is untapped, but some of the few things it could be used for include:
          improving supply chain systems, enhancing customer satisfaction,
          increasing a business's general productivity, and training AI.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Training AI Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-training-ai">
        <h2>Training AI for Specialized Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          AI learns like a child; it grows its knowledge by reading information
          and experiencing things. Nothing but the very basics was ever
          programmed into an AI system. Dark data can be used to expedite the
          time it takes for AI to learn a specific skill. Essentially, more data
          means a greater bank of knowledge, allowing the AI to be more accurate
          in its responses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Optimizing Manufacturing Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-optimizing-manufacturing">
        <h2>Optimizing Manufacturing and Supply Chain Systems</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most significant causes of delays in manufacturing is the
          lack of consistency or poor configuration in machinery. An article by
          Splunk on the topic mentioned that by analyzing automatically
          generated system logs, systems can be tweaked and recalibrated to
          ensure the best possible performance, leading to more time-efficient
          systems and ultimately better profit margins.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Improving Customer Experience Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-improving-customer-experience">
        <h2>Improving General Customer Experience</h2>
        <p>
          For the success of a business, it is vital that the customer has a
          good experience with the business and the products or services that it
          offers. From analyzing dark data, patterns of behavior can usually be
          found, such as the popularity of a product in certain areas, the time
          between purchases, or the success of marketing strategies. This
          information can be put together to form a larger picture, allowing
          businesses to tailor their strategies to attract more sales.
        </p>

      <!-- Social Media Engagement Section -->
      <div class="positive-uses-social-media">
        <h2>Social Media Engagement</h2>
        <p>
          A largely untapped market for easy brand analysis is social media.
          Social media interactions and analytics qualify as dark data, per the
          definition. Today, social media is one of the most effective and
          simplest ways to understand public sentiment about a product. Almost
          every social media platform features engagement metrics (e.g., watch
          time, views, likes, etc.) that are widely used by companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other component of dark data from social media, the physical
          engagement, is far less used but just as indicative. Monitoring
          customer messages and comments—asking questions or providing
          feedback—are rarely practiced, but they are an easy way to enhance the
          understanding of public perception regarding the brand. In an article
          on the topic, Alexis C. Madrigal of The Atlantic commented:
          “Surprisingly, almost 70% of all social media interactions with brands
          are classified as dark data.”
