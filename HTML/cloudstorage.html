        <p class="cloud-storage-parra">
          Dark data is data that is data that is stored and not used in anyway.
          Cloud storage has made data storage more accessible and cheaper for
          large and small company's to store data this means that Dark Data
          easier to store. Larger companies to hold more data in the cloud such
          as backups Seagate done a study, rethink data, in 2020 to see how much
          dark data they and some other companies where storing. Seagate alone
          stored 500TB of data in the cloud thatâ€™s only 70TB less than their own
          data warehouses this shows how popular that cloud storage has become.
          Seagate also predicted a 47% increase in data that company's store
          with this the % of dark data will also increase. With cloud storage
          becoming cheaper its easier to store data that is not needed (Dark
          data) on both personal and corporate levels. Im going to explore both
          side of dark data in cloud storage is this webpage.

        <h2>personal use of cloud computing</h2>
        <p>
          Cloud computing is great for the average person because it allows
          cheap storage that can be accessed anywhere in the world. It also
          allows multiple people in the world to connect to the same cloud
          space. According to a cloud storage company Mimedia (mainly focused on
          photo and video storage) say that people store up to 1,400 photos on
          their servers. This is about 7 GB of data per person that can produce
          about 3 kg of Co2 per person. Think about the last time you looked at
          your cloud photos. Not just photos but personal data, for example
          emails, names, addresses and card details. Companys like this hold a
          lot of personal data that you might not use that will become dark
          data. There is much more personal dark data that is held by companies,
          for example social media platforms save all posts and comments. Thats
          a lot of dark data even when deleted social media platforms will still
          store some of this data. Most if not all of this data is saved in the
          cloud as the cloud is cheaper than running their own data centers.
          Cloud file systems are also great for people as they allow people to
          access files on any computer and anywhere in the world. This
          incentivizes people to move to more cloud-based systems and programs.
          All this cloud data is easily forgotten about on the cloud. This leads
          to companies not being able to remove these files and data as the user
          has not requested it. So, all photos, posts, files and more are stored
          on your behalf. So, without people clearing old cloud storage there is
          dark data being stored maybe without them knowing about it.
        </p>

      <div class="cloud-storage-heading">
        <h1 class="cloud-storage-header">business use of cloud computing</h1>
        <p class="cloud-storage-parra">
          Cloud computing is also a great way for companies to store data.
          Companies are always looking for a cheaper way around problems. Cloud
          storage is cheaper in the short run as the set up for a large data
          center is expensive this makes cloud storage more accessible than
          large data centers. With companies moving more towards cloud storage
          it is cheaper to store data dark data is becoming more common. No
          matter how much storage a company's uses they still have to pay for a
          block of data. So, if a company buys a block of cloud storage, for
          example 1TB, then even if they use 400GB of it they still have to pay
          for 1TB of storage. This gives companies less incentive to clear out
          old data as it costs them the same amount of money. Regulations also
          state that companies must hold data Sutch as policy's in healthcare
          must hold records on all patients even years after they patients have
          move GP or hospitals. This means that after such policy's companies
          will hold the data and forget to remove it this leads to more dark
          data being produced. Companies also store data that they think there
          are going to use in predictions or statics and is never used. This
          data could also be used and left on servers/ storage for later use and
          never ends up being used. This data could be things such as annual
          profit numbers that a business would store or old videos or pictures
          that a social media business would store incase of loss of data/
          corruption so everything could be restored. As cloud data is more
          accessible and cheaper, this all leads to more dark data in companies.
          This correlates to SeaGates study as they found out how much dark data
          they really had they also predicted it.

      <div class="cloud-storage-left">
        <h2>conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          In conclusion cloud storage has made dark data more common across the
          world both on a personal level and business level. A personal level
          people take photos post and make files and ever use them again. A
          business stores data that they think they might need or is storing for
          meeting regulations but is probably never going to be used. More and
          more data is being stored in the cloud as its cheaper and easier to
          access. This is also making more Co2 then ever before as we are
          relying more and more on data and information.
