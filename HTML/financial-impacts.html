          Financial Impacts of Dark Data
        </h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="financial-impacts-dark-data-header-paragraph">
          It's well known that storing data has a cost. While storing photos,
          videos, and applications on personal devices may seem small, it adds
          up. For businesses, these costs are far more significant. Omdia
          estimates that annual data storage costs hit around $57 billion, with
          forecasts predicting an increase to $128 billion by 2028. If half of
          this data is dark data, it's crucial to reduce and optimize dark data
          storage.

      <!-- In Context: Netflix Example -->
      <div class="financial-impacts-dark-data-netflix">
        <h2>In Context: Netflix Spending on Data Storage</h2>

        <p>
          Netflix collects around $8 billion in quarterly revenue, with growth
          year over year. The company relies on AWS storage servers, paying
          approximately $28 million monthly—or about $366 million annually—for
          media storage. Although manageable for Netflix, it raises questions:
          how much of this data is essential for service functionality?
        </p>

        <p>
          Industry Expert Prukalpa Sankar estimates that 65% of Netflix's stored
          data is dark data, which equates to around $6.2 million monthly on
          largely untouched data. This cost could be better allocated if time
          and resources were dedicated to dark data reduction and management.

      <!-- Risks of Dark Data Breaches -->

        <h2>Another Financial Impact of Dark Data: Breach Risk</h2>

        <p>
          With data storage comes breach risks, especially with dark data.
          Improperly stored data can lead to costly legal repercussions and
          fines.

      <!-- Equifax Data Breach -->
      <div class="financial-impacts-dark-data-equifax">
        <h2>The Equifax Data Breach</h2>

        <p>
          Equifax, a credit reporting company, faced the devastating impact of
          dark data mismanagement in September 2017, when a massive data breach
          exposed personal information of nearly 150 million Americans,
          including sensitive details like credit scores, full names, and
          addresses. Improper management of dark data worsened the situation,
          exposing even more private data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Equifax faced multiple state fines and a settlement costing around
          $1.3 billion. The breach left Equifax with financial loss and a
          damaged reputation.
